# Mission-to-Mars
Write a script that would gather data about the mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location, without having to manually gather the data.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a web page that will scrape new data, in the form of the most current Mars news & a featured image on a couple of NASA websites, as well as some Mars Facts and images of Mars Hemispheres from chosen websites.  Once data is gathered, place it all into one HTML web page.
